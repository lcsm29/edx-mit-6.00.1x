# [edX MIT 6.00.1x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7) - Intro to CS and Programming Using Python
I have already [finished](https://github.com/lcsm29/MIT6.0001) the same course on OCW ([MIT 6.0001 Fall 2016](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)) a few weeks ago (at least finished the problem sets), but that one was pretty old and things started to break down (e.g. feedparser). Also, I don't know whether my implementation or style is acceptable or not, as I don't have anyone to review my code. It passed the provided test algorithm, but that's about it. Then, I found this newer course on edX. The one thing that hooks me to the course is graded assignements and exams, because that's exactly what I needed. So I enrolled to the course. I'm still not sure what exactly the 'graded' means. If it means another sets of automated unit tests, then it's almost useless. If it means grading by human, then it might be useful.

## Resources
The following resources are the carbon copy of the resource page of the course.

### Documentations
* [Official Python 3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) - "official"/technical explanation of what a particular function/operator does, examples of correct syntax, what the various libraries are, etc.
* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) - Style Guide for Python Code - learn what is good and bad style in Python

### Textbooks
* [Dive Into Python](https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/) (free) - another survey of Python syntax, datatypes, etc.
* [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by Allen Downey (free) - a good general overview of the Python language. Includes exercises.
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/) (free) - another free online text
* [Get Programming: Learn to Code with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming) by Ana Bell (course staff) - a basic intro to programming if you are having trouble keeping up with the course
* [Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/) by Luciano Ramalho - an advanced book

### Tutorials
* [The Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) - self-explanatory
* [Reserved Keywords in Python](https://docs.python.org/3.0/reference/lexical_analysis.html#id8) - don't use these as variable names
* [CheckIO](https://checkio.org/) - learn Python by exploring a game world
* [Invent with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/) - develop your Python skills by making games or hacking ciphers
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog) - (note: for Python 2) learn Python by building web apps and manipulating data; interactive tutorial sequence
* [Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/) - interactive tutorial sequence of exercises
* [Blog with tutorials](https://mitxcsjourney.blogspot.com/) - created by one of our community TAs
* [Study Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oMYRnogRrGgCtz-26E8hJYLp7Bm99JS1SP4lhdXvqpw/edit#heading=h.wkdtdlnax0u3) - created by another of our community TAs

### Debugging
* [Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/) - an excellent way to actually visualize how the interpreter actually reads and executes your code
* [DiffChecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/) - compares two sets of text and shows you which lines are different
* [Debugging in Python](https://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/debugging-in-python/) - steps you can take to try to debug your program

### Software
* [Python Tools for Visual Studio](https://microsoft.github.io/PTVS/) - Visual Studio plug-in enabling Python programming

### Other Q&A
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) - a large Q&A forum for programming concepts (not just Python). Try searching here before you post on the edX forum, and you may find that someone has already answered your question.

### More practice problems
* [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) - a series of puzzles you can try to test your Python abilities
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - additional programming challenges you can try once your Python knowledge becomes stronger; problems are sorted by increasing difficulty
* [Coding Bat](https://codingbat.com/python) - problems you can solve within an online interpreter
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/?language=python) - improve your skills by training on real code challenges
