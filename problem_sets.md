# Unit 1: Python Basics
## Problem Set 1
### Problem 1
10.0/10.0 points (graded)

Assume `s` is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string `s`. Valid vowels are: `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`. For example, if `s = 'azcbobobegghakl'`, your program should print:

`Number of vowels: 5`

### Problem 2
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
Assume `s` is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the number of times the string `'bob'` occurs in `s`. For example, if `s = 'azcbobobegghakl'`, then your program should print

`Number of times bob occurs is: 2`

### Problem 3
15.0/15.0 points (graded)
Assume `s` is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of `s` in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if `s = 'azcbobobegghakl'`, then your program should print

`Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh`

In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if `s = 'abcbcd'`, then your program should print

`Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc`

Note: This problem may be challenging. We encourage you to work smart. If you've spent more than a few hours on this problem, we suggest that you move on to a different part of the course. If you have time, come back to this problem after you've had a break and cleared your head.
